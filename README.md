# MLTutorial
A notebook tutorial designed by Tahseen Rabbani for building ML classifiers, produced for UMD Combine Peer-2-Peer Learning.

In this tutorial, we design a classifier to differentiate between healthy red blood cells and sickle cells. I've built up custom datasets extracted from Google images for your use. The notebook itself is intended to be mounted on Google Colab, but you can also just manually import the healthy and sickle image directories.
